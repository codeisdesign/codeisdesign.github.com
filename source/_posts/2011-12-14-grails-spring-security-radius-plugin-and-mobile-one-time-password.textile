I released today <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-radius">spring security RADIUS plugin</a>. Motivation behind this plugin was to enable one-time passwords for Grails applications.

Static passwords are not very safe way to authenticate. If intruder gets password, he can simply login to the system. One-time password helps to overcome this shortcoming. If intruder gets the password, it is no longer valid.

I tried to find open source OTP project and found <a href="http://motp.sourceforge.net/">MOTP</a> project. Project started back in 2003 and it offers authentication server which is RADIUS server that supports authentication with OTP tokens and client that is used to generate OTPs for the authentication.

In development I used <a href="http://motp-as.network-cube.de/">Mobile-OTP Authentication Server</a> which is out-of-the-box authentication server. It's really simple to install to your virtualization environment such as <a>Virtual Box</a>.

You can find tutorial from <a href="http://smakela.github.com/grails-spring-security-radius/">plugin documentation</a> how to secure your Grails application with one-time password.

Enjoy your secure Grails application!
