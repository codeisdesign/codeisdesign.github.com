h2. Introduction

p<. I could not find step by step instructions how to set two simple Grails applications to use single-sign on, so this first blog post is going cover that.

My case was this:

bq. When logged in to a secured application, how to see content on another secured application without login hell?

Obvious answer was to use single-sign on. For end user point of view it's just one login and you are good to go.

Sound pretty nice, but how to accomplish this in Grails?

To make our application secure Mr. <a href="http://burtbeckwith.com/" target="_blank">Burt Beckwith</a> has created a collection of Spring Security plugins.

We are going to user Spring Security Core plugin and Spring Security CAS plugin.

*CAS* stands for *Central Authentication Service*. It's a single-sign on protocol for the web.

h2. Setting up Tomcat for CAS server

First you need some servlet a container. In this example we use Apache Tomcat (I used version 7).

<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Download Apache Tomcat</a>

Unarchive Apache Tomcat to some directory in your computer.

We must configure CAS to use SSL so we need to create Certificate Keystore:

{% codeblock %}
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias cas -keyalg RSA
{% endcodeblock %}
{% codeblock %}
keytool -genkey -alias cas -keyalg RSA
Enter keystore password:
Re-enter new password:
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  localhost
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Test
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  Test
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:
Is CN=localhost, OU=Test, O=Test, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?
  [no]:  yes

Enter key password for &lt;cas&gt;
	(RETURN if same as keystore password):
{% endcodeblock %}

Default password for keystore that Tomcat uses is "changeit". So we are going to use that. Command creates .keystore -file to your home directory.

Now go to the *conf/ *-folder of Tomcat and open the* server.xml *-file. We have to add SSL Connector:

{% codeblock %}
&lt;Connector
port=&quot;8443&quot; maxThreads=&quot;200&quot;
scheme=&quot;https&quot; secure=&quot;true&quot; SSLEnabled=&quot;true&quot;
keystoreFile=&quot;${user.home}/.keystore&quot; keystorePass=&quot;changeit&quot;
clientAuth=&quot;false&quot; sslProtocol=&quot;TLS&quot;/&gt;
{% endcodeblock %}

Now we have set up our Tomcat to use SSL we need to export the certificate and import it as a "trusted" certificate to our "cacerts" keystore in Java Runtime (JRE) *lib/security* -folder.

{% codeblock %}
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -export -alias cas -file ~/cas.crt -keystore ~/.keystore
{% endcodeblock %}
{% codeblock %}
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -import -alias cas -file ~/cas.crt -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
{% endcodeblock %}

For Mac users "cacerts" can be found from */Library/Java/Home/lib/security/cacerts*. (Note! You must use sudo to apply the command)

{% codeblock %}
Enter keystore password:
Owner: CN=localhost, OU=Test, O=Test, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown
Issuer: CN=localhost, OU=Test, O=Test, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown
Serial number: 4e25a98a
Valid from: Tue Jul 19 18:58:02 EEST 2011 until: Mon Oct 17 18:58:02 EEST 2011
Certificate fingerprints:
	 MD5:  E8:B7:11:26:87:81:77:18:78:E1:6F:81:5B:29:BF:6E
	 SHA1: AE:8D:3A:16:29:B2:84:58:4D:DC:15:53:F7:F5:15:34:BB:E2:70:3A
	 Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA
	 Version: 3
Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore
{% endcodeblock %}

That is all you have to modify from the Tomcat (*NOTE: This is not a production set up!*)

h2. Configure and Compile CAS server

Now we need to download, configure and compile the CAS server (I used version 3.4.8).

<a href="http://www.jasig.org/cas/download">Download CAS Server</a>

Unarchive CAS Server to some directory in your computer.

In this setup we are going to use text file as a user database for authentication. It's pretty handy for testing purposes. It's not recommended for production setup.

Go to the* cas-server-webapp/* -folder in the CAS Server and open* pom.xml* -file. We need to add dependency to cas-server-support-generic -module.

{% codeblock %}
		&lt;dependency&gt;
     		&lt;groupId&gt;${project.groupId}&lt;/groupId&gt;
     		&lt;artifactId&gt;cas-server-support-generic&lt;/artifactId&gt;
     		&lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
		&lt;/dependency&gt;
{% endcodeblock %}

Go to *cas-server-webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/* -folder in the CAS Server and open *deployerConfigContext.xml* -file.

{% codeblock %}
&lt;bean class=&quot;org.jasig.cas.adaptors.generic.FileAuthenticationHandler&quot; p:fileName=&quot;file:/path/to/file/authentication_database.txt&quot; /&gt;
{% endcodeblock %}

Replace SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler with FileAuthenticationHandler in the section "auhenticationHandlers".

Create *authentication_database.txt* -file  that holds username/password pairs. Change the path in FileAuthenticationHandler to point to your file.

{% codeblock %}
codeisdesign::password
admin::password
{% endcodeblock %}

Go to the *cas-server-webapp/* -folder in the CAS Server and create war -package from the webapp. You need to run:

{% codeblock %}mvn package{% endcodeblock %}

Now you have *cas.war* in your *cas.server-webapp/target/* -folder. Copy *cas.war* -file to your Tomcat installations* webapps/* -folder and you have CAS Server installed.

h2. Configuring your Grails applications

In this example I have two Grails applications "sso-example-1" and "sso-example-2", which both have single controller and they are secured with Spring Security.

Here's the scenario:

# User goes to "sso-example-1" application -&gt; http://localhost:8081/sso-example-1
# User gets redirected to the CAS Server for authentication.
# After authentication user is redirected back to the "sso-example-1"
# User goes to "sso-example-2" application  -&gt; http://localhost:8082/sso-example-2
# User is already authenticated and content is shown.

You must configure CAS plugin in your applications *Config.groovy* -file.

Here's configuration for "sso-example-1" and "sso-example-2"

{% codeblock %}
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.loginUri = '/login'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.serviceUrl = 'http://localhost:8081/sso-example-1/j_spring_cas_security_check'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.serverUrlPrefix = 'https://localhost:8443/cas'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.proxyCallbackUrl = 'http://localhost:8081/sso-example-1/secure/receptor'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.proxyReceptorUrl = '/secure/receptor'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.logout.afterLogoutUrl ='https://localhost:8443/cas/logout?url=http://localhost:8081/sso-example-1/'
{% endcodeblock %}

&nbsp;

{% codeblock %}
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.loginUri = '/login'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.serviceUrl = 'http://localhost:8082/sso-example-2/j_spring_cas_security_check'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.serverUrlPrefix = 'https://localhost:8443/cas'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.proxyCallbackUrl = 'http://localhost:8082/sso-example-2/secure/receptor'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.cas.proxyReceptorUrl = '/secure/receptor'
grails.plugins.springsecurity.logout.afterLogoutUrl ='https://localhost:8443/cas/logout?url=http://localhost:8082/sso-example-2/'
{% endcodeblock %}

More about plugin configuration you can find from the <a href="http://burtbeckwith.github.com/grails-spring-security-cas/" target="_blank">plugin homepage</a>.

We also need same users to exist in the application which were in the *authentication_database.txt. *That is done in Bootstrap.groovy.
{% codeblock %}<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;white-space:normal;">Now we have configured applications and we are ready to test! Start your Tomcat instance (CAS Server), "sso-example-1" and "sso-example-2"*.*</span>{% endcodeblock %}
CAS Server is running in 8080 and 8443 ports so you need to run "sso-example-1" on port 8081 and "sso-example-2" on port 8082 as configured in Config.groovy. To do this, you can define port in the run-app -command:

{% codeblock %}
grails -Dserver.port=8081 run-app
{% endcodeblock %}

Just go to<a href="http://localhost:8081/sso-example-1" target="_blank"> http://localhost:8081/sso-example-1</a> and authenticate. Then go to  <a href="http://localhost:8082/sso-example-2" target="_blank">http://localhost:8082/sso-example-2</a> and that's it. No more another login.

You can find source codes for both applications from Github.com

<a href="https://github.com/smakela/sso-example-2" target="_blank">Get SSO Example 2</a>
