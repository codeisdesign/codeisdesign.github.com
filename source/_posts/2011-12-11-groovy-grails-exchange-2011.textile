Although I could not be in the Groovy &amp; Grails Exchange, I have watched lot of speaks from the conference.

Really enjoyed Guillaume's keynote about Groovy 1.8, Burt Beckwith talk about Spring Security Core plugin and Groovy running on Android (Discobot).

I was glad to hear that Grails 2.0 FINAL will be released next week. Really good news, because it's gonna make my life easier on daily basis.

If you missed the conference as I did, you can go the Skills Matter website and check all the great speaks from the conference.
